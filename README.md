# Reviews_Sentimental_Analysis
# Overview
This project analyzes customer reviews to better understand how people feel about a product or service. It combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with two powerful approaches to evaluate sentiment in text. The first approach focuses on rule-based analysis of language tone, while the second leverages an advanced transformer model to detect subtle patterns in wording.

# Purpose
The aim is to transform raw customer feedback into meaningful insights that can guide decision-making. By measuring emotions expressed in reviews, the analysis highlights patterns of satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and neutrality across different ratings. This empowers teams to identify strengths, uncover areas for improvement, and monitor changes in customer perception over time.

# Benefits
1) Actionable insights: Helps leadership and product teams quickly understand what drives customer satisfaction.
2) Comparative analysis: Shows how different models interpret sentiment, ensuring more reliable findings.
3) Decision support: Identifies trends in customer perceptions to guide product improvements, marketing strategies, and service enhancements.
